    "# TF-IDF\n",

    "In information retrieval, **tf–idf** or **TFIDF**, short for **term frequency–inverse document frequency**, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes today; 83% of text-based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf-idf.\n",

However, in the case where the length of documents varies greatly, adjustments are often made (see definition below). The first form of term weighting is due to Hans Peter Luhn (1957) which may be summarized as:\n",

Hence an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.\n",
